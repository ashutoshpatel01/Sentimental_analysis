Twitter Sentimental Analysis
This tool is an implementation of the Twitter Sentiment analysis tool described on Laurent Luce's blog.
Training data
The training data is obtained from the Twitter Search API with the keywords I am happy and I am sad for happy (positive) and sad (negative) tweets. There is a total of 160 tweets used for training (80 / 80 distribution).

To add more training data, add in new happy tweets to happy.txt and sad tweets to sad.txt using one line for each new tweet.

Test data
Test data are separated into happy_test.txt and sad_test.txt. A total of 20 tweets are used for test (10 / 10 distribution).

To add more test data, add in new happy tweets to happy_test.txt and sad tweets to sad_test.txt using one line for each new tweet.
